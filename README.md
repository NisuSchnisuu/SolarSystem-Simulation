# Solar System Simulation

An interactive 3D simulation of the solar system, designed for educational purposes (Grade 6 level). This project visualizes realistic planetary orbits, moon phases, seasons, and includes a "Deep Space" exploration mode.

**Live Demo:** [https://nisuschnisuu.github.io/Simulation-Mondphasen/](https://nisuschnisuu.github.io/Simulation-Mondphasen/)

## Key Features

*   **Realistic Orbits:** Visualizes the relative movements of Earth, Moon, and other planets.
*   **Moon Phases:** Interactive controls to jump to specific moon phases (New Moon, Full Moon, etc.).
*   **Seasons:** Demonstrates how Earth's tilt affects seasons in Europe.
*   **Camera Modes:**
    *   System View, Earth View, Moon View.
    *   **Photography Mode:** Take virtual photos of space with adjustable ISO and Zoom.
    *   **Gallery:** Save and view your snapshots.
*   **Time Control:** Pause, rewind, and adjust the simulation speed.
*   **Deep Space:** Explore beyond the solar system (Black holes, other stars).
*   **Fun Extras:** Hidden UFO events, Comet tracking, and more.

## Tech Stack

*   **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (3D Rendering)
*   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **PWA:** Progressive Web App support (installable on mobile).
